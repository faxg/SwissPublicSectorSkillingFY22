## Goals

Please create a solution prototype that may help people build and maintain their personal "resilience", work&life balance and find new ways for satisfiying the sometimes contradictionary needs of people when it comes to the new "hybrid workplace".

Please do **NOT** create anything like to following (or at least - add some new, innovative twists):

- Another "Mental Health" Q&A chatbot
