## Blazing Fast Developer Environments

[https://hackzurich.com/media/pages/data/events/events-2021/blazing-fast-cloud-developer-environments/3431020934-1631785936/baracktocat-800x-q70.jpg]
No time to lose getting ready for your Hackathon project? Spin up your dev environment in the cloud in just a few seconds. Runs in the cloud and faster than on your laptop - powered by GitHub Codespaces and Visual Studio Code.

We will show you how to get ready for hacking on your GitHub repository in no time, using GitHub Codespaces and deploy to Azure. You'll never want to go back to your Desktop IDE again ;-)
See https://github.com/features/codespaces for more details.
