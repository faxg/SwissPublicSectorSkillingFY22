# Datasets and APIs

Here you find publicly available datasets, APIs and survey results that could be interesting to use.
Although by no means required, we would be curious to see what you can achieve with some these datasets and APIs.

**Please note:** As these are public / 3rd party resources, our team might not be able to help you with all your questions around these.

**Note \#2**: Please keep in mind the **solution and value to the end user**.
A cool ML model is only useful if it supports solving a specific solution to the challenge problem, from a user perspective.
