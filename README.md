### SwissRe + Microsoft Hackathon Challenge: Crazy new normal (Personal resilience)
Tech & Data can do a lot to transform insurance, but can it also increase Personal Resilience? We want to develop a solution to boost personal resilience and smooth the transition when we move to the hybrid working environment.

After the initial shock from the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, it has become clear that home office can work well. Moving back to a hybrid working approach can mean more distractions, a stressful commute and less flexibility in general. How can we navigate this transition? How can we integrate some of the benefits we enjoyed when working from home? And if things get too much, where can we get support when needed, in particular, for our mental health? We at Swiss Re believe that it's important to take the positive learnings from the past 18 months and create a work environment where people can come back feeling safe and can thrive, very much in the spirit of Swiss Re's ”Own The Way You Work” (OTWYW) approach. Help us develop solutions to support Personal Resilience and help our people to be their personal best in this crazy new normal.

### Microsoft Learn - Cloud Skills Challenges
We greated a small set of "skilling challenges" to get you prepped up for the event (and developer life ;-)).
These are collections of tutorials and browser-sandbox based hands-on examples on Microsoft Learn we think you find valuable.
You might need to register for an MS Learn account first to join the challenges.

The challenges run for one week - starting **Friday 17.09.2021** until **Friday 24.09.2021**.
There will be a leaderboard, for some gamification, e.g. friendly competition of learners. If you made it through all the modules we selected (no cheating ;-)), 
feel free to stop by the Microsoft Booth on Saturday and we'll have some small giveaway for you (subject to availability).
